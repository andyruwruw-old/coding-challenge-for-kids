# Sonar Treasure Hunt

Sonar is a technology that ships use to locate objects under the sea. 

The player places sonar devices at various places in the ocean to locate sunken treasure chests. The sonar devices (in our game) can tell the player how far away a treasure chest is from the sonar device, but not in what direction.

But by placing multiple sonar devices down, the player can figure out where exactly the treasure chest is.

---

## 1. Details

There are three chests to collect, but the player has only sixteen sonar devices to use to find them. Imagine that we could not see the treasure chest in the following picture.

Because each sonar device can only find the distance but not direction, the possible places the treasure could be is anywhere in a ring around the sonar device.

Functions provided for you will create an `array of arrays` holding the image of the ocean.

Chests are stored in an `array` AS `arrays` with the `x` and `y` positions as values.

Store your previous moves in an `array` as `arrays` of the `x` and `y` positions.

Premade functions are available here for printing purposes:
