# Tic-Tac-Toe Hint

[Go Back to Lab Description](./README.md)

Use a while loop for the game, with the boolean being a `gameOver` variable set to false. Only set it true if the board is full, or someone wins.

Use the values `0` for empty, `1` for Player 1 and `2` for Player 2.

Keep track of turns by creating a `turn` variable set to `0`. After each turn, if it's `0` change it to `1` and vice versa.

You gotta write a bunch of `if statements` to check if someone has won! Additionally a `for loop` to check if the boxes are all filled.'

## Hints for printing

If you're using python or javascript, this might be difficult to print given that after every print command, it automatically enters an `end line`. Try creating an empty string, adding to it, printing it when you want a new line, and reseting it to empty.
