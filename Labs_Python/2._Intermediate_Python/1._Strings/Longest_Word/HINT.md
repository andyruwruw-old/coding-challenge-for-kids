# Longest Word Hint

[Go Back to Lab Description](./README.md)

Use a `For-Loop` to run through all the words!

Have a variable for the longest word and set it to an empty string to start.

For each word in the list, if the `length` of the word is larger than the `longest word`, then set the `longest word` equal to that word.

Continue until you've gone through all the words, then print the longest word!
