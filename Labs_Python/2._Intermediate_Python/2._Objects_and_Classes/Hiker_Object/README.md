# Hiker

As an intro to classes, have the students implement a hiker with the described methods.

## 1. Details

Each hiker should posess the following traits inicialized by the constructor.

- Name: String
- Altitude: Number
- Thirst: Boolean

The following methods should be implemented as well.

- climb(amount) : Adds to 'altitude' by 'amount', sets 'thirst' to 'true'.
- descend(amount) : Subtracts 'altitude' by 'amount', sets 'thirst' to 'true'.
- drinkbreak() : Sets 'thirst' back to 'false'.

Uses: Beginner Object and Classes, If-Statements

## 2. Further Challenges

Thirst should be overloaded to false unless otherwise specified, and altitude set to 0 by default unless otherwise specified.
