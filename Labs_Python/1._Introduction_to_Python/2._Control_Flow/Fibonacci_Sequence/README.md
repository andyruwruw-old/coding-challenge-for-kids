Create a program that generates a Fibonacci Sequence a long as the user wants!

## 1. Details

The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers, by which each number is the sum of the two previous.

```
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...
```
The sequence always starts with 1 and 1, so you can go ahead and print those to start!

Uses: For-Loops
