# Ray Gun Hint!

[Go Back to Lab Description](./README.md)

Mirrors can also be thought of as duplicate rooms that flip over the wall as the axis. Duplicate the room, flip it over each wall as the axis, and you have a **direct** line towards a new enemy that has the same angle as if you bounced it.

Choosing how many rooms to duplacate and flip in each direction depends on how far the ray gun reaches.

If you successfully get an array of positions of mirrored enemies, you can solve this solution using two point formula and distance formula.
