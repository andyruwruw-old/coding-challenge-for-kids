# Censored Files

An application which takes in an input file, requests bad words from the user, and outputs to a new file the same text but with the words removed.

---

## 1. Details

The program created should ask for words to be censored, to be place in an array. It should then read through the input file, and copy text over to the output, removing bad words.

Ensure that lowercase and uppercase words work as well!

---

## 2. Sample Output

```
What word would you like removed (/done to move on): Blah
What word would you like removed (/done to move on): Mine
What word would you like removed (/done to move on): I
What word would you like removed (/done to move on): /done
New File Created.
```

## 3. Futher Challenges

Edit the program to allow it to handle multiple words in succession.

Or, allowing it to censor two words together, such as `hello there`.
