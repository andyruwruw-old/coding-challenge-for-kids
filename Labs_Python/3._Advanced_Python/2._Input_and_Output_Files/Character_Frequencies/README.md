# Character Frequencies

An application which takes in an input file and finds the frequency of every unique character.

---

## 1. Details

Your program will open an input file, find the frequency of every unique character, and write the data to a new output `.txt` file.

This should be done using a dictionary to keep track of unique characters along with their values (`keys value pairs`).

Uses: Dictionaries, Arrays, Tuples, Input / Output Files, Sorting
